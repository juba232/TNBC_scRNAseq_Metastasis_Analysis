# 4. Pathway Enrichment Analysis

Enrichment using clusterProfiler.

## Workflow

- GO Biological Process
- Upregulated vs Downregulated pathways
- Visualized with dotplot, barplot, cnetplot

## Key Findings

- [x] Upregulated: ECM organization, angiogenesis
- [x] Downregulated: immune response, T cell activation

## Outputs

- [x] go_upregulated.png
- [x] go_downregulated.png

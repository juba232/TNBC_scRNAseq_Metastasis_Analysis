TNBC Single-Cell RNA-seq Metastasis Analysis

Comprehensive scRNA-seq analysis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) using patient-derived single-cell transcriptomic data (GSE118389).

🔬 Project Goal

Identify metastatic subpopulations and molecular drivers of metastasis using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).

📌 Key Results

908 high-quality TNBC cells analyzed

16 transcriptionally distinct clusters

3 metastasis signatures applied (Arteaga, MammaPrint, Werb)

25% of cells classified as high-metastasis

710 differentially expressed genes

ECM remodeling & immune evasion identified as major pathways

Six candidate therapeutic targets identified

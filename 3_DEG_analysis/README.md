# 3. Differential Expression Analysis

Differentially expressed genes between high-metastasis and low-metastasis cells.

## Workflow

- Wilcoxon Rank Sum test

- logFC threshold = 0.1

- Adjusted p-value < 0.05

- Extract top markers

  - Visualize with:
  - Volcano plot
  - Heatmap (top 30 genes)

## Outputs

- [x] volcano.png
- [x] heatmap_top30.png
- [x] Table of all DEGs (csv)

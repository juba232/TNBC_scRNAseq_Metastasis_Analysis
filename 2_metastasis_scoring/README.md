# 2. Metastasis Signature Scoring

## Metastasis potential calculated using:

- Arteaga signature

- MammaPrint signature

- Werb signature

## Workflow

- [x]AddModuleScore for each gene set

- [x] Combined metastasis score

- [x] High vs Low metastasis classification (75th percentile cutoff)

## Outputs

- [x] UMAP colored by metastasis score

- [x] High-met vs Low-met distribution

- [x] Cluster-wise metastasis enrichment
